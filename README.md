### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

### I like to code 
The programs I made are usually related to finance. Python is usually what I use, but sometimes I use C or Java. Other than programming, I like economics, finance, nutrition, and movies. 


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building finance and economics tools
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how LSTMs work
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything finance related
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about any of my repositories
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Discord 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like giraffes ğŸ¦’
